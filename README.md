# <span style="color:blue">Meanify</span>

Meanify is a dictionary app built with Spring Boot, HTML, and CSS. It provides an efficient and user-friendly experience for users to look up words and expand their vocabulary.

## Features

To create a meaningful project, I used the Free Dictionary API from [https://dictionaryapi.dev/](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

**API Usage**
-------------

The basic syntax of a URL request to the API is as follows:

```bash
https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>
```

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository or download the source code**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/swarupt29/Meanify.git
```
